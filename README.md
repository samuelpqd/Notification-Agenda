The Repository
-------------

The main purpose of this repository is to allow engagement with the user base of Notification Agenda and at the same time share everything from the public side of the application's development.

Did you find a new bug? Would you like to see some new feature implemented? Is a particular feature already planned? Do you want to discuss a new idea? Or maybe you simply want to give some feedback or start a general discussion. Either way, the [issue tracker](http://github.com/rfgamaral/Notification-Agenda/issues) is the right place for all that.

Version 1.x.x
-------------

Starting with the next major version, Notification Agenda will only support Android 2.3 and above. Support for Android 2.1 and 2.2 will have to be dropped due to requirements for planned new features.

Updates to the current v1.x.x branch will focus only on small improvements and bug fixing.
